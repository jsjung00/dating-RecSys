# Content Based E-Dating Recommender System 

## Motivation 
Tinder wrote about their matching algorithm TinVec in 2017, which required access to a dataset of swipes across users to generate profile embeddings. 
This motivated the following question: *without this data assumption, how would one recommend a profile while dealing with the cold-start problem?* 
This project utilizes solely image profile information (where images are embedded into a vector space) to recommend a cluster of people (i.e a certain category) to the user. 
To effectively explore and get feedback from the user, it uses unsupervised clustering (k-means) to generate broad strokes categories and then utilizes UCB to determine which categories would be more beneficial to get feedback from the user from both an exploration and exploitiation perspective.   

To generate the suggested category, it uses the rated subset of embeddings to construct a rating for all embeddings and then returns a clique of similar images that best represent the user's preferences.  

### Dataset
The profile images come from the TMDB, the Movie Database, which contain profile pictures of various actors and celebrities. The current dataset is little less than 5000 images of actors in the age range 20-40. 

### Method

## Embedding and Clustering 
In order to work with the image data, it uses MTCNN to extract the facial region which is inputted to VGG-Face, a pre-trained CNN trained specifically on faces, to get a vector embedding.
The vectors are then grouped into $k=10$ clusters using k-means.

The image embedding is particularly crucial- on a smaller dataset of CFD, using the OpenCV facial region detector in conjuction Facenet led to incoherent clusters, where dissimilar faces, including different sexes, where clustered together. 
We note that the current embeddings from VGG-Face often lead to clusters which group images by similar races or racial features. A embedding generated by facial landmarks might facilitate more racial-agnostic recommendations. 

## Efficient exploration 
The main constraint is that for $5000$ images, the user only provides like or dislike ratings for a select $T = 30$ images. Given the need to explore and present all possible categories while also getting info on which categories might have a higher preference rating, we currently use UCB algorithm. For the first $10$ rounds we pull each "arm" once, drawing an unseen image randomly from the cluster- for the remaining rounds, it
